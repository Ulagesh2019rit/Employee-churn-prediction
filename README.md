 # Detailed description:
  I have used the below modules for my experiment in the given order:

Data set-Data set required for experiment is added Editing Metadata-Used to change data type of fields, etc. Splitting data-Split the data for training and evaluation. Two-class Decision forest-Classification algorithm is used for training a model. The output values is 0 or 1. Two class Decision forest gives the accurate and quick results. 0 denotes that the employee will not leave the company and 1 means employee will leave the company.

Model Training-Algorithm and the training data set are the input given for the model training. Score model-Score model provide the output by adding two more columns. We can visualize the datasets by clicking visualize. Evaluate model-This will give the accuracy, matrix values. The model gives an accuracy of 96.9% and precision of 93.6%.

Permutation feature-responsible for the correct output.

After creating, run the model by clicking run. we can score and evaluate the model.
